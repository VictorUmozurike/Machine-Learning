This is a diabetes prediction web app made using python create the base of the app (the trained model) then using spyder to produce the programmed predictions and calculations it will do.
and after that, with the use of the computer's base terminal, i was able to download the extra programs and files (i.e sklearn) then run the app on my browser.


To start, i made using the trained model using google collab, as any python platform works to make it. 
Then I created a fresh new environment on anaconda and downlAoaded streamlit through the terminal, which downloaded most of the programs that the future code would need to understand and function. Although, i did have to use the direct app of anaconda to download and run sklearn as downloading streamlit didn't
After that, using this new environment, i opened Spyder and created the python Web App file, adding in the function of how the app will take in multiple units of numbers correlating to diffrenet values of what a person would physicaly be like (i.e BMI ratio, Age, pregnancies), as well as adding the response of if someone is diabetic or not.
After completing all of that, i, or you if you want, can then run the app by opening the terminal and running "streamlit run (insert file explorer directory)". You must put the directory of the file alongside the file itself. for example "streamlit run C:\Users\ADMIN\Documents\Victor Prediction Web App"
